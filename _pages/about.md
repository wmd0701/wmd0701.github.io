Hi! I am Mengdi, nice to meet you! I am currently a PhD candidate and research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Enkelejda Kasneci at the Chair of Human-Centered Technologies for Learning, Technical University of Munich. I earned my master degree of Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich and bachelor degree of Informatik: Games Engineering at Technical University of Munich. 

My research focuses on federated learning, split learning, computer vision, and general deep learning. My overarching goal is to address privacy issues inside/via machine learning.
